# Intermediate Ruby Obstacle Courses

This repo contains a collection of "obstacle courses" that are laser-focused on _quickly_ leveling up very discrete skills.

I'm building these resources to help myself learn (slowly) and then to be able to hand this resource to someone else, and in a _fraction_ of the time it took me to learn this, I want them to be able to learn >60% of what I've learned.

### Current "obstacle courses"

## Nokogiri Obstacle Course

> Become a better developer

isn't super actionable.

On the flip side

> Write good tests for your views

is actionable, and has the side effect of helping you get better at writing integration tests that use css-selector-based assertions.

To test your views, you need to understand the basics of parsing the DOM. To do this, you need to use a tool called `nokogiri`.

Beyond testing views, you can also use nokogiri to scrape websites.

Before I started this Nokogiri project, I said to myself:

> Hey, I kinda know how to use Nokogiri...

And could kinda-sorta stumble my way through some web scraping, but I couldn't do anything complicated with it, and didn't feel confident that I could sit down and scrape arbitrary data from an arbitrary webpage.

So, change into the `nokogiri` directory and work through the readme!
